                <h1>What is project life cycle?</h1>
                <p>The project management life cycle describes high-level processes for delivering a successful project.<br>Wasted money and resources can be prevented with effective project management, as more than half of unsuccessful projects fail due to communication breakdown.<br> In the phases of the project management life cycle, you come up with the idea for a project, define its goals, plan for its execution, and guide it to completion.
                    In essence, the project management life cycle divides the project into distinct phases, each with its own set of goals and deliverables. This helps project managers and teams to systematically plan, execute, and monitor the project's progress, addressing any issues or changes as they arise. The life cycle framework ensures that every aspect of the project is thoroughly considered, from initial planning to final evaluation.
